<!--1.TYPES OF CSS STYLING
        
        A. INTERNAL CSS STYLING: For this, you can just name the HTML attribute by name or class or a specific id. 
            e.g  Is it a Paragragh, a named id or class you want affected by it. 
                1.You could use 'P' when you want to target all the paragraghs on the page.
                2.You could use a specific id. For eample, if you want only one paragragh affected,
                    you could name the paragragh using an id. You could go to the <p> html attribute and give it an id 
                    i.e. <p id="paragragh1"> and then you indicate this using the #symbol before the {background...}
                3. You could also use the Class after indicating the class after the html element in order to differentiate it. 
                    For example; you could identify a particular class with <p class="top" id="paragraph1"> and then you indicate this using 
                    a full stop and then the name of the class you indicated i.e. .top{background...}
            
                Also, the INTERNAL CSS STYLING is always in the HEAD TAG unlike the Inline CSS Style.

                Example: in between a style tag <style></style>, you have any of these;

                 1. p{ background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff} - All HTML paragragh attibutes
                 2. #paragraph1{ background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff} - The named paragragh1 indicated 
                 3. .top{background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff}  - The indicated class 
                You may also list all the tags or attibutes you want affected. All you have to do is to list all before the {background...}
                e.g. h1,h3,p{background...}

        B. INLINE CSS STYLING: It only affects the line or paragraph in which it is placed.

        C. EXTERNAL CSS STYLING: For this, you have to create a new CSS File and list out your changes/effects/targets 
           by stating all the attributes or tags you want affected. 
           After this, you link the HTML file(webpage) with the CSS file using the link tag on the html webpage.

           For example; THIS IS USED TO LINK BOTH THE HTML AND CSS:
           
           <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"> (This is in between the head tag though.)

           2. FONTS IN CSS
        There are two categories of fonts.
         1. Serif
         2. Sans Serif: Highly recommended. Easier to read.
         You may choose others you like too.

        Taxation of employment income falls under the Personal Income Tax. 
        It requires a special consideration because the preponderant majority of those paying personal income tax in Nigeria are in paid employment
        and subject to the Pay As You Earn Scheme (PAYE). Also, taxation of employment income constitutes an important source of revenue for state governments in Nigeria.
        It is instructive at the onset to note that PAYE is not a separate tax. 
        Rather, it is a form of withholding tax system or deduction of tax at source in order to reduce tax evasion.</p>
