    <!-- TYPES PF CSS STYLING
        
        1. INTERNAL CSS STYLING: For this, you can just name the HTML attribute by name or class or a specific id. 
            e.g  Is it a Paragragh, a named id or class you want affected by it. 
                1.You could use 'P' when you want to target all the paragraghs on the page.
                2.You could use a specific id. For eample, if you want only one paragragh affected,
                you could name the paragragh using an id. You could go to the <p> html attribute and give it an id 
                i.e. <p id="paragragh1"> and then you indicate this using the #symbol before the {background...}
                3. You could also use the Class after indicating the class after the html element in order to differentiate it. 
                For example; you could identify a particular class with <p class="top" id="paragraph1"> and then you indicate this using 
                    a full stop and then the name of the class you indicated i.e. .top{background...}
            
                Also, the INTERNAL CSS STYLING is always in the HEAD TAG unlike the Inline CSS Style.

                Example: <style>
                 1. p{ background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff} - All HTML paragragh attibutes
                 2. #paragraph1{ background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff} - The named paragragh1 indicated 
                 3. .top{background-color:#350303; color:#f8fcff}  - The indicated class  -->
    

    <style>

    p{
        background-color:#be1717; 
        color:#f8fcff
    }

    </style>
  </head>
